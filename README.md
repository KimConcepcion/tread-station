Tread Station
=============

Wirelessly control your treadmill, replace the old lackluster dashboard with graphics and workout analytics! Replace the dashboard with a monitor and add a small computer and you have a Treadmill Workstation.

ABOUT ME
I've replaced my old treadmill dashboard with a 27" monitor and hooked it up to a Mac Mini. My keyboard, mouse and touchpad are all wireless. This is sweet! A workstation without the wires and controllable via a web page. This should help get me back to health. Already I feel more energy, and more creativity as I work a difficult day job that requires me to be at the computer long periods of time.

Directories
===========
  * nodejs - the control software for BeagleBoard Black devices (http://beagleboard.org/black)
  * web-ui - Web user interface based on Angular.JS and D3D.js. Works in remote browser or in kiosk mode on BeagleBone Black with touch LCD

Deprecated Code
  * mac - a Mac OSX widget 
  * spark - control firmware on particle.io (spark.io) boards (this platform never worked well, buggy network protocols)
  * particle - part of the spark implementation
  * uExpect - small C websockets implementation (was used for spark platform)


Features
========
  * Controls both speed and incline
  * morphs speed to the desired speed, no fast changes
  * contains soft limit for testing (reduces max speed)
  * saves state of incline level to EEPROM. To calibrate, reduce platform to zero incline and use Incline("CALIBRATE") function to reset saved level.
  * can retrieve local IP for direct local connection via TCP (websockets communication coming)

Upcoming Features
=================
  * measures pulses from a hall-effect sensor and uses a rolling average
        currently my reed switch sensor on my treadmill appears broken, so I did not implement this right away.
  * WebSockets implemented within the spark to allow direct communication from browsers. Will use the
    cwebsockets project. Waiting to fix above outstanding item before complicating the code.

Issues
======
  * currently dealing with a major issue where the spark board resets (blinking reds) after about 10 mins of connectivity
    via TCPServer.

Progress
========

The code for the controller is done besides the outstanding issues. Currently working on the web interface in HTML5 which
is half complete of the dashboard only.

Control Interface
=================

Access the following variables and functions through the spark cloud interface. The user interface uses a faster direct 
interface which provides realtime feedback and control.

Variable         | Type       | Description                                                                             
---------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
speed           | integer    | the current speed output to the controller 
desiredSpeed    | integer    | the desired speed setting. current speed will catchup or fallback to this speed at the set morph rate 
enabled         | bool       | true if platform motion is desired (platform will slow to a stop if this is set false) 
running         | bool       | true if the platform is in motion (this is the actual state of the platform)           
incline         | integer    | current incline setting 
desiredIncline  | integer    | the desired incline setting 
inclineInMotion | integer    | 0 if the platform is not inclining, +1 if inclining positive, -1 if negative. 


Function          | Description
----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Speed          | treadmill platform speed in tenths of a millisecond (Range is 90 to 410, i.e. 9ms to 41ms) Also supports speed verbs {STOP, START, PANIC}, safe limit verbs {REDLINE, SAFE}, or accelleration profile verbs {AX_CRAWL,AX_SLOW,AX_MEDIUM,AX_FAST}.
Incline           | achieve desired incline level, 0=floor to 100=max incline or use verbs {FLOOR,CALIBRATE}. CALIBRATE will set the current incline to zero (floor) but perform no physical motion.
Flags             | Modify or query system state. first character is the operator (+,-,^,?) or no operator to query flag value. Returns the state of the given flags as a bit-mask. See below for flag and operator descriptions.

SYSTEM STATE/OPTION FLAGS

Operator  | Description
:--------:| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 +  |  Set the given option(s) in the system. Un-mutable flags or options will not be affected.
 -  |  Removes the given option(s). Un-mutable flags or options will not be affected.
 ^  |  Toggles the given options(s), uses an XOR operation. Un-mutable flags or options will not be affected.
 ?  |  Returns the ordinal value of the given flag(s). Used by the interface to interrogate the enum value of the flag, not the current state of the flag.
None | Returns the current state of the given flag(s)/options(s) as a bitmask. Use the ? operator to determine the ordinal value of each flag.

Flag                  | Description
--------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE_CLOUD          | Set to enable the transmission of spark-based cloud events. WebSockets was chosen to supercede this option.
CLIENT_CONNECTED      | True if a client is directly connected to the controller via TCPServer/WebSockets.
NO_CLOUD_WHEN_LOCAL   | Turn off cloud communication when a client is directly connected. Cloud communication is only needed to determine the sparks ip address, thus cloud communication just unnecessarily takes resources at that point. When the client drops, cloud communication will be re-established.

Electronics

LOW PASS FILTERS:
  Let's talk about low pass filters. :)  The treadmill controller generates a lot of noise on the signals, both the speed
  signal and the incline sense. It is important to filter out this noise if we are going to get nice clean signals into
  our spark. This is pretty easy since the noise is of a high frequency and our signals are all well under 1kHz. We could
  use complicated code to debounce the inputs, but why risk introducing bugs and make the code unreadable when a simple
  resistor and capacitor will do?
  
  You need to add low pass filters on all input signals and the speed output signal. The speed output already has a 290ohm
  resistor as a current limit, so a 0.22uF capacitor will do here. For simplicity you can also use the same 290ohm and 0.22uF
  cap on the other lines. This will keep a good low-impedance connection between the signal transmitter and receiver.
  
  I assume your spark controller and the MC2100 is seperated by a long cable, where possible put the filter closest to the
  input/receiver side. That means near the MC2100 for the speed output and at the spark for the sense inputs.
