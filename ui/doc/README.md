* Dial Style Tree
The style tree contains visual and bounds settings for the Dial and it's controls. Here is an example of a dial tree. 
Visual style should be done as much as possible in css, so styles that can be set in CSS such as colors and backgrouns 
are not supported here.
{
    css-theme: "dark-red"
}
